## Introduction

Welcome to my repository of DevOpsJourney. Here I will share my findings and different tasks that I perform in the process of learning something new and share it here. I started the journey of learning about DevOps on 7 July 2023, hoping to complete it by 30th October 2023.

## Goals

I plan to study for 3 hours and then spend 3 hours working on tasks, followed by one day break to recover and perform tasks more effectively.
